## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install MSVC and Setup Developer Environment
- Follow the instructions on this page to ensure that the compiler and command prompt are installed properly
  [Visual Studio Code - MSVC onfiguration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)
  

### 2. Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio
1. Open the **Windows Terminal**.
2. Select the **Developer Command Prompt for VS** profile (itâ€™s automatically available if MSVC is installed).
   - Alternatively, search for "Developer Command Prompt for VS" in the Windows Start menu and open it in the Windows Terminal.

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move to the directory where your project files are located by using the `cd` command in the Developer Command Prompt.

For example:
```bash
cd path\to\your\project
```

## Build and Run Instructions

Run the following commands one by one in the **Developer Command Prompt for VS**:

1. Compile the source file:
   ```bash
   cl /utf-8 main.c
   ```
   This generates the `main.exe` executable file.

2. Change the terminal code page to UTF-8 to support emojis:
   ```bash
   chcp 65001
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   main.exe
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Command Not Found Error**:  
   Ensure you are running the commands in the **Developer Command Prompt for VS**.

2. **MSVC Not Installed**:  
   Reinstall the Visual Studio Build Tools or Desktop Development for C++ Developers.

3. **Icons/Emojis Not Displayed Correctly**:  
   Ensure you changed the code page to UTF-8 using `chcp 65001` before running the game.

Hope you enjoy the game! ðŸ˜Š
